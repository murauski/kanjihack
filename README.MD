**KanjiHack** is the MVP for learning Japanese Kanji in an interactive way.

## The idea of the app is dead simple

It's cards. Each card has a hint and a word to guess and learn. The app presents you with a deck of 10 cards. You see a hint (usually a word written in romaji, hiragana, or your native language)and you should guess and write the word in Japanese using a pen and paper. After that, you tap on the hint, the card flips over and shows you the word written in kanji. If you were right, you swipe the card down (happy, don't show again), and if you were wrong, you swipe up (unhappy, show again). After you have finished with a deck of 10 cards, the next deck will be formed by taking your answers into consideration. The app repeats the cards that you often made mistakes with. So, the more mistakes you make with a word, the more often you have to write it down and learn it. To motivate you, your progress is shown.

 ## The data, list of words to learn

Of course, everyone has their own set of words to memorize, so at the start, the app does not contain any data at all. Instead, you use a Google Spreadsheet to write down your own hints and words to learn, and the app downloads that data straight from the spreadsheet.

***Enjoy!***
