**KanjiHack** is MVP for learning Japanese Kanji in an interactive way.

## The idea of the app is dead simple

It's cards. Each card has a hint and a word to guess and learn. The app presents you with a deck of 10 cards. You see a hint (usually a word written in romaji, hiragana, or your native language)and you should guess and write the word in Japanese using pen and paper. After that you tap on the hint, the card flips and shows you the word written in kanji. If you were right, you swipe the card down (happy, show less), and you were wrong, you swipe up (unhappy, show again). After you are have finished with a deck of 10 cards, there is will be next deck formed taking into consideration your answers. The app therefore presents you with the the cards you made mistakes with more often. So, the more you are mistaking a word, the more often you have to write down it down and learn. There is also your progress shown to motivate you.

 ## The data, list of words to learn

Of course, everyone has her own set of words to memorize, so the app does not contain any data at the start at all. Instead, you use a Google Spreadsheet to write down you own hints and words to learn, and the app downloads that data right from the spreedsheet.

Enjoy!
